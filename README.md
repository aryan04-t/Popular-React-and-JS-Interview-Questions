# üéØ Popular React and JavaScript Interview Questions 

- I just want to keep this repo light weight for better skimming experience before interviews, and I want to target the JavaScript and React interview questions which I have been asked in Interviews before, and the concepts which I feel are important and I can forget them if I am not in touch with them for long time while working on a different tech stack. 
- I know that https://github.com/DopplerHQ/awesome-interview-questions repo exists, and I want to skim through this repo also before interviews, but for me this repo is very vast to go through 1 hour before a React and/or JavaScript interview, and it also doesn't give me a personalized feeling as it is a generic repo just having different different reference articles each having different quality level 


# ‚úÖ Prerequisites 

1. You should already know react and javascript, and you should have built at least 3 big projects with it 
2. You should have at least 1 year of experience working with React and JavaScript at production level 
3. Although even if you don't have 1st and 2nd point completely fullfiled you can still go through this repo, but I won't recommend learning JS or React from this repo as this is not meant for it, and that's why the order in which the concepts of React and JS appear in this repo is also random, this repo is just for experienced SDE-1 or SDE-2 devs, or for experienced Web-Dev interns who want to skim through concepts of react and js:  
  - If they have lost touch to this tech stack or  
  - If they have an interview and want to do a prep or  
  - If they just want to dive deep into famous interview questions of React and/or JavaScript for random revision
