# Popular JavaScript Interview Questions: 

- I just want to keep this repo light weight for better skimming experience before interviews, and I want to target the JavaScript interview questions which I have been asked in Interviews before, and the concepts which I feel are important and I can forget them if I am not in touch with them for long time while working on a different tech stack. 
- I know that https://github.com/DopplerHQ/awesome-interview-questions repo exists, and I want to skim through this repo also before interviews, but for me this repo is very vast to go through 1 hour before a JavaScript interview, and it also doesn't give me a personalized feeling as it is a generic repo - and I can't really highlight the topics in which I am weak specifically.
